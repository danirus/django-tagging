Installation
============

Thanks for downloading django-tagging.

To install it, run the following command inside this directory:

    python setup.py install

Or if you'd prefer you can simply place the included ``tagging``
directory somewhere on your Python path, or symlink to it from
somewhere on your Python path; this is useful if you're working from a
Subversion checkout.

Note that this application requires Python 2.7 or later, and Django
1.4.5 or later. To cover previous versions checkout the original source 
at:

* `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tagging/0.2.1>`_
* `Code Google Hosting <http://code.google.com/p/django-tagging/>`_
* `GitHub <https://github.com/brosner>`_

You can obtain Python from http://www.python.org/ and
Django from http://www.djangoproject.com/.
